2411 N Willow. The block also continues
before you towards the higher numbers.

OW1

You are standing at the doorstep of 2400
N Willow. The house is old looking with
little care taken of the lawn. Weeds 
spring up everywhere. There is a welcome
mat at your feet and a the door has a
knocker shaped like an apple.

OW2

You are in a kitchen. There is a slight
smell of cigarrette smoke in the air.
The kitchen counter has pots and pans
all over and the sink is filled with
dishes. A table is set in the middle
with a nice cloth and doilies. A door
leads to the living room.

sit numerous frames containing photos,
covered in dust. There is an old TV
playing a movie on mute. There are exits
to the bathroom, kitchen, and back outside.

OW4

You are in a bathroom. There is a very
strong smell of cigarrette smoke and

of the space in this room. There is a
door back to the living room.

two years ago.

MJ1

You are on the doorstep of 2422 N Willow.
There is loud music coming from the house,
something like Bob Marley but with a hip
modern twist. It sounds awful. The lawn
is very tall and the blinds of the house
are drawn.

MJ2

You are in a living room. There are black
light posters all over the walls and

coming from the house. The lawn looks
freshly cut.

couch with clothes strewn across it. A 
bookcase that houses a television and some
blu-rays. You can also see a coffee table
with an empty wine glass. There are a
bedroom and what looks like a study
adjoining the room.

You are in a bedroom. The room is very
messy. There are clothes scattered
everywhere and on top of the bed lies
a partially filled suitcase. On a
dresser you see a piece of paper.

TH3

You are in a study. The room is lined
with bookcases. There is one space in
the bookcases that looks like a perfect
fit for the book you have with you. On
a desk in the middle of the room you
notice a phone, the answering machine
next to it is blinking.

The lawn looks a little overgrown. The
doorbell is shaped like a cat wrapped
around a ball.

KT2

This living room smells like cats.
There are three scratching posts in the 
room, and some posters of kittens in what
looks like unnatural poses. There are
a few cat toys on a table.

KT2

The kitchen is very dirty. There are
plates and boxes on the ground. It seems
as if the cat has knocked them off of
the counter at some point. Bits of old
food are caked onto the tile floor.
You can see a cabinet and a few drawers.
There is also a cat food dish on the floor.

KT3

You are in a bedroom. This room is very neat.

burn something inside of.
